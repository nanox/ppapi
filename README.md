# Pepper code location

Currently the canonical version of the PPAPI code has moved to the Chromium subversion repo http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/ppapi/ to help with browser versioning and dependencies (see Get the code for more details). We're still working out what role this public repo should have (maybe it will be a copy of the public interface where it's easier for external projects to pull from).
